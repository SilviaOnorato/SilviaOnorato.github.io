# Hello everybody and welcome to my web page!

## What I work on

I'm Silvia Onorato, PhD Student at Leiden Observatory, working in the [ENIGMA](http://enigma.physics.ucsb.edu/index.php?n=Main.HomePage) group led by Prof. Joseph F. Hennawi. 
I study high-redshift quasars (z>6.5), focusing on the analysis of optical and NIR spectra that are taken with _Keck/NIRES_, _Gemini/GNIRS_, and _VLT/X-Shooter_ spectrographs and then reduced with the open-source Python-based spectroscopic data reduction pipeline _PypeIt_.
The goal of my PhD project is to infer information both on the average hydrogen neutral fraction at the epoch of Reionization and on the growth of the first super massive black holes.

## About myself

I was born in Palermo on the 15/06/1996 and until 19 years old I lived in my hometown, Bagheria (PA). Then I moved to Bologna, where I graduated in astrophysics at the _Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna_. During my Master thesis I worked on Globular Clusters (GCs), studying the distribution of Multiple Populations in the isolated and dynamically young system NGC 2419 to place observational constraints on the initial formation and evolution scenarios of GCs (_Onorato et al. in prep_). During my PhD project I've been moving to the research field I'm currently working on, focusing on high-z quasars.

I like spending my leisure time with friends, watching  tv-series or movies, listening to music, reading books and travelling.
